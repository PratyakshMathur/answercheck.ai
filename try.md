#  Steps
## I will use Computer vision to extract text from the exam paper and the solution key
## I will use NLP to measure the simmilarity of the answers and then make a threshold of it 
## This will handle partial grading as well as direct grading 

# Challenges
## I will face challenge in extracting messy handwritten text which might lead to noisy data
## Making the partial grading functionality will not be easy
